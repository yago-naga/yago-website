YAGO 3 taps into multilingual resources of Wikipedia, getting to know more local entities and facts. This version has been extracted from 10 different Wikipedia versions (English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Romanian, Persian, and Arabic). YAGO 3 is special in several ways:\n* YAGO 3 combines the clean taxonomy of WordNet with the richness of the Wikipedia category system, assigning the entities to more than 350,000 classes.\n* YAGO 3 is anchored in time and space. YAGO attaches a temporal dimension and a spatial dimension to many of its facts and entities.\n* In addition to taxonomy, YAGO has thematic domains such as “music” or “science” from WordNet Domains.\n* YAGO 3 extracts and combines entities and facts from 10 Wikipedias in different languages.\n* YAGO 3 contains canonical representations of entities appearing in different Wikipedia language editions.\n* YAGO 3 integrates all non-English entities into the rich type taxonomy of YAGO.\n* YAGO 3 provides a mapping between non-English infobox attributes and YAGO relations.\nYAGO 3 knows more than 17 million entities (like persons, organizations, cities, etc.) and contains more than 150 million facts about these entities. As with all major releases, the accuracy of YAGO 3 has been manually evaluated, proving a confirmed accuracy of 95%. Every relation is annotated with its confidence value. ",
