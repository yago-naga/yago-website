    <h1>YAGO 2</h1>

    <p>YAGO 2 is an improved version of the original YAGO knowledge base:</p>

    <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>
            YAGO 2 is anchored in time and space. YAGO 2 attaches a temporal dimension and a
            spacial dimension to many of its facts and entities.
        </li>

        <li>
            YAGO 2 is particularly suited for disambiguation purposes, as it contains a large number of names for
            entities. It also knows the gender of people.
        </li>

        <li>
            As all major releases, the accuracy of YAGO 2 has been manually evaluated, proving an accuracy of 95% with
            respect to Wikipedia. Every relation is annotated with its confidence value.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How to use YAGO 2</h1>
    <p>
        YAGO classifies each entity into a taxonomy of classes. Every entity is an instance of one or multiple classes.
        Every class (except the root class) is a subclass of one or multiple classes. This yields a hierarchy of classes
        —
        the taxonomy. The YAGO taxonomy is the backbone of the ontology, and is designed with much care and attention to
        correctness.
    </p>

    <p>
        In YAGO (as in RDF), each fact consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. Every fact can have a fact id.
        For example, the fact &lt;Elvis_Presley&gt; rdf:type &lt;person&gt; could have the fact identifier &lt;id_42&gt;.
        YAGO contains facts about these fact identifiers. For example, YAGO contains
    </p>
    <ul >
        <li><code>&lt;id_42&gt; &lt;occursSince&gt; "1935-01-08"</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;id_42&gt; &lt;occursUntil&gt; "1977-08-16"</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;id_42&gt; &lt;extractionSource&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/Elvis_Presley&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These facts mean that Elvis was a person from the year 1935 to the year 1977, and that this fact was found in
        Wikipedia.
    </p>

    <h1>Data</h1>
    <p>
        The YAGO 2 knowledge base is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License</a> by the YAGO team of the
        Max-Planck Institute for
        Informatics. The version number of this data is 2.3.0. The data was extracted from the 2010-08-17 version of
        Wikipedia.
    </p>

    <p>
        YAGO 2 is available in two data formats:</p>
        <ul  class="browser-default">
        <li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href=/data/yago2/yago-2.3.0-native.7z>native</a>
        <li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"
        href=/data/yago2/yago-2.3.0-turtle.7z>Turtle</a>
           </ul>

    <p>
        While the Turtle format is the <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/>W3C standard</a>, the native format has the advantage that it includes the meta facts (“facts about facts”) and information about the textual context of entities (anchor texts etc.). The native format consists of a set of
        files, which together constitute the knowledge base. The files that start with an underscore are internal files
        that will be of little use to the end-user. The other files are named after the relation they contain. For
        example, the file “ismarriedto.tsv” is a TSV file that contains 3 columns: a fact id, a subject, and an object
        &mdash; meaning that the subject was married to the object, and that this fact has the given fact id.
