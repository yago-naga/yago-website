    <h1>YAGO2</h1>

    <p>YAGO2 is an improved version of the original YAGO. Its main characteristics are:</p>

    <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>
            YAGO2 is a knowledge base that is anchored in time and space. YAGO2 attaches a temporal dimension and a
            spacial dimension to many of its facts and entities.
        </li>

        <li>
            YAGO2 is particularly suited for disambiguation purposes, as it contains a large number of names for
            entities. It also knows the gender of people.
        </li>

        <li>
            As all major releases, the accuracy of YAGO2 has been manually evaluated, proving an accuracy of 95% with
            respect to Wikipedia. Every relation is annotated with its confidence value.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How to use YAGO2</h1>
    <p>
        YAGO classifies each entity into a taxonomy of classes. Every entity is an instance of one or multiple classes.
        Every class (except the root class) is a subclass of one or multiple classes. This yields a hierarchy of classes
        â€”
        the taxonomy. The YAGO taxonomy is the backbone of the ontology, and is designed with much care and attention to
        correctness.
    </p>

    <p>
        In YAGO (as in RDF), each fact consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. Every fact can have a fact id.
        For example, the fact &lt;Elvis_Presley&gt; rdf:type &lt;person&gt; could have the fact identifier &lt;id_42&gt;.
        YAGO contains facts about these fact identifiers. For example, YAGO contains
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;id_42&gt; &lt;occursSince&gt; "1935-01-08"</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;id_42&gt; &lt;occursUntil&gt; "1977-08-16"</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;id_42&gt; &lt;extractionSource&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/Elvis_Presley&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These facts mean that Elvis was a person from the year 1935 to the year 1977, and that this fact was found in
        Wikipedia.
    </p>

    <h1>Data (with license)</h1>

    <p>
        YAGO2 is available in two data formats: the native format and RDF. While RDF is the standard for triple data,
        the native format has the advantage that it stores the fact identifier. The native format consists of a set of
        files, which together constitute the knowledge base. The files that start with an underscore are internal files
        that will be of little use to the end-user. The other files are named after the relation they contain. For
        example, the file "ismarriedto.tsv" is a TSV file that contains 3 columns: a fact id, a subject, and an object
        &mdash; meaning that the subject was married to the object, and that this fact has the given fact id.
